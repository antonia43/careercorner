# Career Corner

Helping you build your career, every step of the way.

## Overview

Career Corner is an AI-powered application designed to help high-school students and professionals make informed career decisions. Whether you're a high-school student preparing for exams and struggling to pick a degree, or a professional seeking a career change or job opportunities based on your skills, Career Corner provides comprehensive support through two dedicated interfaces: one for high-school students and another for university students and professionals.
As former high-school students and aspiring data scientists themselves, the creators of Career Corner have experienced firsthand the lack of clear guidance during critical career processes: vague psychotechnical tests at school that fail to reveal true interests, scattered information making degree selection overwhelming, and lack of helpful information for professionals who are trying to identify transferable skills or navigating daily job struggles.

Career Corner aims to solve these challenges by combining conversational AI, real Portuguese educational data, and practical career tools to deliver personalized guidance far superior to traditional generic advice. Portuguese high school students benefit from adaptive career quizzes, CIF grade calculators, degree/university matchers with interactive maps, and study resources including IAVE exam archives and DGES degree data. Professionals access CV parsing, CV-aware career growth quizzes and tailored mock interview simulators with STAR feedback. 
Both user types can enjoy smart chat interfaces that route them to optimal tools and have the ability to save all results to "My Reports" for usage in other tools and persistent access across sessions, connecting school performance and career pathways in one cohesive platform.


**Target Audience:**
- **High school students** (Career and degree discovery, Grade calculation/preparing for university admission)
- **University students & professionals** (CV analysis, Career Recommendations, Interview preparation)
- **Focus (student section):** Portuguese education system (DGES degrees, National exams); Although tools are also available for international students.

## The Problem

### For Students:

Students face psychotechnical tests at school that don't connect interests to real university options, yielding vague results that don't help in decision making. Grades exist in isolation requiring manual calculation of the final highschool grade in order to find suitable degrees.

- Vague school career tests lacking personalization
- Confusion about degree choices and university options
- No real time connection between grades, interests, and real admission data
- Information scattered across multiple platforms (DGES, university sites)


### For Professionals:

Professionals send CVs everyday but get no structured skill analysis or interview practice catered to their needs, which might be beneficial if they want to succeed. Additionally, some professionals might want a career change but don't know what skills they can explore.

- Difficulty identifying transferable skills for career changes
- Generic job search tools without personalized insights
- No structured way to connect CV strengths to career paths
- Overwhelming job market navigation


## Our Solution

Career Corner delivers personalized guidance through conversational AI that adapts to user responses. 
Students can answer 10 creative questions to get sector matches (i.e. Healthcare 60%, Technology 40%), use the sector match results to explore suitable degrees, upload grade reports (or manually input grades) for final score calculation and get matched to real DGES degrees/universities based on school performance, quiz results and location. 
Professionals can upload their CVs (that get parsed into structured JSON) to get feedback, play CV-aware career quizzes, practice mock interviews tailored by job offer (with feedback) and generate tailored cover letters. 
All results persist in a SQLite database, being easily accessible through a "My Reports" tab and reusable throughout all of Career Corner's features.

1. **Conversational AI:** Interactive quizzes that adapt to user responses (not static multiple-choice)
2. **Real Data Integration:** Uses DGES university data, admission grades, and Portuguese scholarship info
3. **Personalization:** Connects quiz results -> grades -> degree recommendations -> university matches
4. **Actionable and Interactive Tools:** for example, CV analysis, grades analysis, university search, career path recommendations
5. **Observability:** Langfuse tracking of AI interactions for quality assurance during app testing


## Features
Shared for all users:
- **Data Persistence:** SQLite database stores quiz reports, grades, saved universities, CVs.
- **Google OAuth Login:** Secure login with Google accounts.
- **Local Login:** Secure login with accounts created directly on the platform and stored in the database.
- **Dashboard:** A dashboard with an AI career assistant chatbot that interacts with users that aren't sure about how to navigate the app, asking ~5 genuine questions about their situation and redirecting them to the most suitable starting tool after understanding their needs. The chatbot never mentions tool names during the first 5 turns, building context through casual dialogue like "What challenges are you facing with your studies?" or "What's frustrating about your job search?" On turn 6+, it confidently recommends a feature (i.e. "Career Quiz would suit you best because...") with clear reasoning. Both student and professional dashboards use separate chat histories with dedicated trace IDs in Langfuse for observability.
- **Reports Section** A section where all results from quizzes and analyses can be accessed and deleted by the user.
- **Custom CSS styling** Custom green and yellow UI with animations.


### For students:

#### **Career Discovery Quiz**
- Career Discovery Quiz - an interactive quiz operated through AI, to help students figure out their most valuable skills and biggest interests. The quiz asks the students creative/philosophical questions that aren't related to school or studies (i.e. "If you found a hidden path, would you explore it, observe, or do nothing?"), in order to understand the students real personality. At the end, a sector, or a mix of sectors (such as Technology, Health, Business) is attributed to the student based on their answers. Aditionally, a report is delivered, highlighting possible career paths based on the student's answers.

- **What it does:** Interactive conversational quiz (10 questions) to understand user's personality
